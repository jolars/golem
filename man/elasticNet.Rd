\title{Elastic Net Penalty}
\usage{
elasticNet(lambda = NULL, n_lambda = 100, alpha = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{the regularization strength, which can either be a
user-supplied vector of (theoreticall) any length, or \code{NULL}, in which
case golem automatically computes a sequence so that the first value
leads to the null (intercept-only) model.}

\item{n_lambda}{the length of the \eqn{\lambda} sequence -- ignored if
a value is supplied to \code{lambda}.}

\item{alpha}{the elastic net mix, 1 for the lasso penalty, 0 for the ridge,
and anything in between for a mix of the two (the elastic net)}
}
\description{
The elastic net penalty is a mix of the lasso (L1) and ridge (L2)
regularization penalties. This mix is controlled by \code{alpha}, where
a value of 1 imposes the lasso penalty and 0 the ridge penalty, whereas
anything in between serves as a combination of the two.
