Description: Efficient implementations for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation
    (SLOPE): generalized linear models regularized with the 
    sorted L1-norm (Bogdan et al. (2015) <doi:10/gfgwzt>)
    or, equivalently, ordered weighted L1-norm (OWL). Supported models include
    ordinary least-squares regression, binomial regression, multinomial
    regression, and Poisson regression. Both dense and sparse 
    predictor matrices are supported. In addition, the package features
    predictor screening rules that enable fast and efficient solutions to 
    high-dimensional problems.
